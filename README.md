# Netflix Slider

A recreation of the Netflix style slider/carousel component.

This component was originally built with JavaScript and Class components. I wrote about it on (Medium)[https://medium.com/@andrew.tham.cc/recreating-netflixs-slider-component-2d6ad9009ab0] and it has gotten a few views and I've had people message me about it.

I've now rebuilt it using TypeScript
